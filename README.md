An implementation of Tetris in assembly language.

This was originally written in a higher-level language, then ported line-by-line - without optimization - to assembly when I was teaching the language to undergraduates.

This might still be compileable with MASM and runnable in DOSBOX. It was originally written some time around 2007.
